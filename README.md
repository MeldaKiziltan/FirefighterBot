# FirefighterBot
As part of grade 12 Computer Engineering, a partner and I created a fully autonomous Firefighter robot that navigates a maze, locates a potential fire in a room, and puts it out.

Highlights include:
- Programmed the motor system using PWM consisting of a Dual H-Bridge motor driver, DC motors with encoder control to provide precision turning and stopping.
- Created autonomous self-straightening capabilities using a photoelectric sensor and encoders.
- Performed distance calculations utilizing both a SHARP IR sensor and an HC-SR04 Sonar sensor mounted onto modified servo motors to provide 360 degrees of visibility. 
- Prototyped, designed, and etched multiple custom PCBâ€™s for an Arduino shield and a separate sensor control board that included the IR fire detection, LCD display, and photoelectric sensors.
